Task 2:

Assumptions:
1. The webserver has been configured correctly to direct the URL specify below to getinfo.php.
2. The Mysql Server has been configured and running.

Please raise at least 10 suggestions/corrections about these codes.

1. Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ')' in getinfo.php on line 4
Correction: remove the ')' (see the code below)
$ArrayURL = split('/', $_SERVER[REQUEST_URI]);

2. Add '"' (double quote) under $_SERVER On getinfo.php line 5 
Correction: change
$ArrayURL = split('/', $_SERVER[REQUEST_URI]);
to
$ArrayURL = split('/', $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]);

3. Error on getinfo.php line 9 
Correction: on getinfo.php line 9 change
if (is_object($data) = true)
to
if (is_object($data) == true)

4. On getinfo.php line 4 function split deprecated as of PHP verion 5.3.0
Correction: I advise to use explode or preg_split function instead since the split function has been deprecated.

5. Class "dataObj" not found on getinfo.php line 6 since the classname on data.php was baseObj.
Correction: change the "dataObj" to "baseObj" in getinfo.php line 6

6. Missing before statement or Syntax error on test.html line 7.
Correction: Change into <!--//Get the data using ajax//-->

7. 404 not found. Get /getinfo/111 not found on test.html line 10
Correction: change
 "/getinfo/111", {},
to
 "getinfo.php/111", {},

Correction: change "InnoDB" to "MySAM" on data.sql line 18

9. Error on importing Condo table in data.sql
Correction: change "InnoDB" to "MySAM" on data.sql line 26

10. Incorrect table definition in "Condo" Table; there can be only one auto column and it must be defined as a key
Correction: on data.sql line 21 change
"ID BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT,"
to
"ID BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,"
